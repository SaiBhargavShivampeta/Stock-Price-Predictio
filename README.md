# Stock-Price-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project, Stock Price Prediction, is focused on forecasting stock market trends using historical data. The primary objective is to build models that can predict future stock prices and trends, which can assist in making informed investment decisions.

## Key Features

Implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.

### Predictions include both:

**Binary Output:** Predicting whether stock prices will go up or down.

**Continuous Output:** Predicting the actual stock prices for future dates.

Use of data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare historical stock data for analysis.

Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and accuracy.

Visualization of prediction results for better interpretability.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned historical stock market data.

Performed feature extraction and scaling to optimize model inputs.

### Model Building:

Trained various Machine Learning models, including Random Forest and SVM.

Developed Deep Learning models, including LSTM, to capture temporal dependencies in stock data.

### Evaluation and Predictions:

Evaluated models on test datasets to ensure reliability.

Generated binary and continuous predictions, saving the results for analysis.

## Usage Instructions

Run the main Python script:

python StockPrediction.py

### View the results:

Binary predictions: binary_output.html

Continuous predictions: continuous_output.html

Use the run.bat file (Windows) to automate the execution process if needed.

## Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

## Libraries:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn for Machine Learning.

TensorFlow/Keras for Deep Learning.

Matplotlib for visualizations.

Future Enhancements

Expand to include sentiment analysis of financial news.

Develop hybrid models combining ML and DL for improved accuracy.

Incorporate more stock market indices for broader analysis.
